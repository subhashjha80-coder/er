# ExamReady — Ad Manager Fix Guide

## What was broken

| # | Bug | Symptom |
|---|-----|---------|
| 1 | `const adMgr` is block-scoped in admin.html | Clicking "Save Slot", "Save All", "Enable All" etc. does nothing — `ReferenceError: adMgr is not defined` in console |
| 2 | `insertSmartAds` looked for keys `top` / `footer` / `between` / `sticky` but admin saves under `top_banner` / `pre_footer` / `between_sections` / `sidebar_sticky` | Real ad code saved in admin never injected on live pages |
| 3 | Two ad systems (shared.js + ads.js) both injected sticky/mobile-bottom without proper guards | Occasional duplicate ad elements |

---

## Fix A — Admin panel buttons (CRITICAL — do this first)

### Option 1: Drop-in patch file (2 minutes, no code editing)

1. Copy `adfix_patch.js` to your project root (same folder as `admin.html`).
2. Open `admin.html`, find the very last `</body>` tag.
3. Add **one line** just before it:

```html
    <script src="adfix_patch.js"></script>
  </body>
</html>
```

Done. All Ad Manager buttons will work immediately.

### Option 2: Direct code edit (30 seconds)

Open `admin.html`. Search for this exact line (~line 850 inside the inline `<script>`):

```js
// Ad Manager public API
const adMgr = {
```

Change `const adMgr` → `window.adMgr`:

```js
// Ad Manager public API
window.adMgr = {
```

Save. Done.

## Fix B — Live pages don't show saved ads

Open `shared.js`. Find the `insertSmartAds()` function.

Inside it, the injection calls use fixed key names (`top`, `footer`, `sticky`, `between`).
The fixed version in `shared_ad_section.js` resolves key aliases so that if you've saved
code under `top_banner` (the ads.js key) it still gets injected, and vice-versa.

### How to apply

Replace the entire **`// ===== AD SYSTEM =====`** block in `shared.js` with the
contents of `shared_ad_section.js`.

The block starts at:
```js
// ===== AD SYSTEM =====
```
and ends just before:
```js
// Auto-apply on DOMContentLoaded
```

Paste the full contents of `shared_ad_section.js` in place of that block.

## Fix C — native-ads.js (optional but recommended)

If you want ads visible even before AdSense is approved (native placeholder cards),
add `native-ads.js` to every public page after `animations.js`:

```html
<script src="animations.js"></script>
<script src="native-ads.js"></script>   ← add this
```

Or run the one-liner from your project root:

```bash
for f in *.html; do
  [[ "$f" == "admin.html" ]] && continue
  grep -q 'native-ads.js' "$f" && continue
  grep -q 'animations.js' "$f" || continue
  sed -i 's|<script src="animations.js"></script>|<script src="animations.js"></script>\n<script src="native-ads.js"></script>|' "$f"
  echo "Patched: $f"
done
```

## Slot key reference

| Admin saves under | Injected by |
|-------------------|-------------|
| `top` | shared.js (insertSmartAds) |
| `top_banner` | ads.js |
| `footer` | shared.js |
| `pre_footer` | ads.js |
| `inline` | shared.js |
| `inline_1/2/3` | ads.js |
| `between` | shared.js (also accepts `between_sections`) |
| `between_sections` | ads.js |
| `results` | shared.js (getManagedAdSlotHtml) |
| `results_banner` | ads.js |
| `solution_mid` | ads.js |
| `quiz_sidebar` | ads.js |
| `sticky` | shared.js (also accepts `sidebar_sticky`) |
| `sidebar_sticky` | ads.js |
| `mobile_bottom` | both systems |

**Tip:** For slots that appear in both columns, paste the same AdSense code into both keys in Admin → Ad Manager so both systems inject it.
